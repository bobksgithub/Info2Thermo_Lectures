 Thermodynamics started with steam engines. At the end of the 19th century, Ludwig Boltzmann introduced the idea of statistical mechanics, i.e. the idea that complex microscopic interactions would \emph{emerge} by averaging (coarse graining) defined ensembles, and provide the previously discovered equations of state used in the earlier thermodynamics. In the last three quarters of a century, the development of information theory found a different description of entropy, which up to a constant \emph{seems to provide a connection} to thermodynamic entropy.

 A different problem, Maxwell’s demon, has also stymied physicists for about the same time. The solution of this problem has in the last five years or so, shown that it is not only apparently the same, but, in fact a completely different approach than Boltzmann’s using Maxwell’s demon the tool to unite physical entropy and informational entropy.\vskip1ex
In this set of lectures we will describe these two different approaches and, hopefully, show how physical entropy is actually informational entropy.
